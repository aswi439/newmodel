AQI Service — CPCB Sub-Index Calculations & 72-Hour Forecast Rollout
=====================================================================
Implements the official CPCB National AQI methodology (2014 standard) on top of
a prognostic single-column model, coupled two ways to the meteorology.

Architecture
------------
  physics/box_model.py       mass budget: emission, ventilation, deposition,
                             entrainment, stranding aloft  (the chemistry)
  physics/inversion_engine.py inversion diagnostics + the aerosol radiative
                             kernels                       (the meteorology)
  this module                closes the loop between them and maps the result
                             onto the CPCB index

Two-way coupling, solved as a fixed point
-----------------------------------------
Meteorology -> chemistry: the mixed-layer depth sets both dilution AND
accumulation. A collapsing lid strands pollution aloft and concentrates what
remains; a growing lid entrains it back down. This is handled by
`box_model.step`, which is prognostic -- hour N depends on hour N-1, so an
inversion genuinely traps rather than merely scaling a steady state.

Chemistry -> meteorology: the PM2.5 column sets an optical depth, which removes
surface shortwave, which cools the surface, which suppresses buoyancy and
shallows the mixed layer -- which raises PM2.5 again.

Because each direction depends on the other, every hour is solved by Picard
iteration in `_solve_coupled_hour()`. Three properties make the answer
trustworthy:

  * The baseline and perturbed mixing depths both come from
    `pbl_from_stability()`, which is the IDENTITY at zero aerosol cooling. Their
    ratio is therefore a real feedback signal. The previous implementation
    differenced an amplification built from the observed Open-Meteo PBL against
    one built by an unrelated empirical formula; that difference was dominated
    by the mismatch between the two parameterisations and collapsed to exactly
    zero in the shallow-PBL regime the model exists to capture.
  * Shortwave forcing is gated on the actual incoming solar flux, so the daytime
    mechanism is absent at night instead of being applied round the clock with a
    constant coefficient.
  * Nocturnal episodes are carried by a surface thermal-memory term: daytime
    aerosol dimming leaves the surface colder at sunset, strengthening the
    following night's inversion.

Honesty note
------------
This is a parameterised single-column surrogate, not a chemistry transport
model. Emission fluxes and backgrounds in `box_model.SPECIES` are hand-set to
reproduce the order of magnitude and diurnal shape of CPCB Delhi climatology.
No accuracy figure should be quoted for this model unless code in `tests/`
computes it against withheld observations.

    other. The loop trial-steps a CLONE of the column to find the self-consistent
    depth, then commits exactly one real step at that depth so the prognostic
    mass budget stays exact.

    `plume_pm25` is the smoke concentration in the transport layer arriving over
    Delhi this hour; the box model applies it as an elevated regional background.

    `cooling_carry_k` is the surface thermal memory from preceding hours
    (positive kelvin of cooling); it is what keeps the feedback alive after
    sunset, when the shortwave term is necessarily zero.
