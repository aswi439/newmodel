"""
Atmospheric Inversion Engine
============================
Computes thermal inversion diagnostics from pressure-level temperature data,
and provides the physical kernels used by the two-way meteorology <-> chemistry
coupling in `services/aqi_service.py`.

Meteorology -> chemistry (dilution):
  dT = T(925 hPa) - T(1000 hPa)
  dT > 0  =>  temperature increases with altitude  =>  inversion (warm lid)
  Pollutants mix through the boundary layer, so surface concentration scales
  as (reference PBL / actual PBL).

Chemistry -> meteorology (aerosol radiative effect):
  PM2.5 column -> aerosol optical depth -> reduced surface shortwave
              -> surface cooling -> weaker buoyancy -> shallower PBL
  which raises PM2.5 again. `aqi_service` closes this loop by fixed-point
  iteration; every kernel below is a pure function so the loop is testable.

Design rule that matters: `pbl_from_stability()` is the ONLY place a PBL height
is perturbed, and it is the identity map when the aerosol cooling is zero. The
baseline and the perturbed PBL therefore always come from the same function, so
their difference is a real feedback signal rather than an artefact of comparing
two different PBL parameterisations.

Data source: Open-Meteo pressure-level API (free, no key needed).
