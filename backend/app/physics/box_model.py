"""
Single-Column Box Model (prognostic mixed layer + residual layer)
=================================================================
Why this exists
---------------
The earlier forecast scaled emissions by (reference PBL / actual PBL). That is a
STEADY-STATE assumption, and it cannot represent trapping. Trapping is not a
dilution effect -- it is accumulation: emissions keep entering a shallow layer
faster than ventilation removes them, so the concentration climbs hour after
hour. A 1/h scaling gives the same answer at hour 1 and hour 9 of an inversion,
which is exactly the phenomenon this project is supposed to forecast.

It also broke the diurnal shape. Delhi's observed morning peak and afternoon
minimum come from mixed-layer growth entraining cleaner air and stranding
pollution aloft, then re-entraining it the next morning. That needs a memory of
what is above the boundary layer.

What this implements
--------------------
The classical two-reservoir slab model:

  * Mixed layer, depth h, uniformly mixed, column mass m [µg/m²], C = m/h
  * Residual layer, occupying [h, h_res], uniform, column mass r [µg/m²]
  * A regional background concentration the column relaxes toward

Per time step:
  1. Emit into the mixed layer:      m += E · dt
  2. Relax toward background:        first-order loss with timescale tau
  3. Adjust depth:
       h grows  -> entrain from the residual layer first, then background
                   (this is the classic morning fumigation peak)
       h shrinks -> mass above the new top is STRANDED into the residual layer
                   and does not return until the layer grows again

Loss timescale combines deposition and ventilation out of the urban domain:

      1/tau = 1/tau_dep  +  U / L

with L the city length scale. So a calm night has a long residence time and a
windy afternoon a short one -- the wind field does real work here rather than
just being displayed on the dashboard.

Honesty note
------------
Emission fluxes and background concentrations below are hand-set so the column
reproduces the ORDER OF MAGNITUDE and the diurnal SHAPE of CPCB Delhi monthly
climatology. They are not an emissions inventory and they have not been fitted
to, or validated against, withheld observations. Do not quote an accuracy figure
for this model that is not produced by code in `tests/`.
