"""AQI sub-index and category regressions.

The headline bug here (AUDIT.md §4.1) was that EPA breakpoint segments were
transcribed as integer-bounded ranges, leaving numeric gaps between them --
pm10 54 -> 55, pm25 12.0 -> 12.1, no2 53 -> 54. `_sub_index` fell through every
segment and hit a bare `return 500`, so a PM10 reading of 54.5 µg/m³, which is
clean air, was reported as maximum severity. Because AQI is the max over
sub-indices and the citywide number averages stations, one station in a gap
dragged the whole city dark red. It was live in the sidebar's "EPA NowCast" mode.

The fix has two parts and both are tested: truncate to EPA reporting precision
before lookup (which is what the EPA method actually requires, and what closes
the gaps by construction), and clamp out-of-range values instead of defaulting
to 500.
