# Delhi NCR AQI Forecasting System

> **72-hour coupled AQI forecast** for Delhi NCR: a prognostic two-reservoir column
> model driven by live meteorology, with real aerosol→radiation→boundary-layer
> feedback and NASA FIRMS stubble-plume transport, behind a live station dashboard.

## What it does

- 🌡️ **Inversion engine** — ΔT = T(925 hPa) − T(1000 hPa), lapse rate, severity bands, and the resulting suppression of mixing depth
- 📦 **Prognostic column model** — mixed layer + residual layer with an explicit mass budget, so a lid that holds overnight actually accumulates pollution and a collapsing lid strands mass aloft
- 🔄 **Two-way coupling** — PM2.5 → AOD → surface shortwave loss → cooling → shallower boundary layer → higher PM2.5, closed by Picard iteration and reported hour by hour
- 🔥 **Plume transport** — NASA FIRMS detections, FRP-derived emissions, hourly 850 hPa trajectories, and smoke attribution by a no-smoke counterfactual run
- 📊 **CPCB AQI** — official 2014 sub-index methodology for PM2.5, PM10, O3, NO2, SO2, CO (US EPA breakpoints + NowCast available for the live panel)
- 🖥️ **Operator console** — a React front-end at `/console` with a 72-hour scrubber over an atmosphere cross-section, the two-way coupling loop, the stubble-plume map, and the live station grid; falls back to a clearly-labelled synthetic sample when the live forecast is unreachable
- 🔒 **Hardened** — API-key auth on mutation, per-endpoint rate limits, strict CSP, non-root containers
- 🐳 **One-command deploy** — `docker-compose up`

**What it is not:** there is no horizontal grid, no advection of the urban pollutant
field, no gas-phase chemical mechanism, and no WRF-Chem. It is a single-column
surrogate, chosen so the forecast returns in seconds against live data. No accuracy
figure is quoted anywhere in this repository, because nothing in it has been
validated against withheld observations yet. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full scope statement.

## Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Docker ≥ 24.0 and Docker Compose ≥ 2.20
- Two free API keys (see below). Both are issued instantly and neither costs anything.

### 1. Clone & configure

```bash
git clone <repo-url> delhi-aqi
cd delhi-aqi
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```bash
APP_API_KEY=your-strong-random-key-here     # python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
OPENAQ_API_KEY=your-openaq-key              # https://explore.openaq.org/register
FIRMS_API_KEY=your-nasa-firms-key           # https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov/api/area/
```

Both data keys are **required for the features that depend on them**, and the code
degrades honestly rather than inventing data:

- Without `OPENAQ_API_KEY`, every `/realtime/*` endpoint returns `502` — OpenAQ v3
  rejects unauthenticated requests, and only the retired v2 API was open.
- Without `FIRMS_API_KEY`, `/plume/vectors` returns an **empty** hotspot list and the
  dashboard says so. There is no synthetic fire generator; one existed and was
  deleted, because fabricated detections on a map are indistinguishable from
  observations to whoever is reading the screen.

### 2. Launch

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Wait ~60 s for the backend healthcheck, then open:

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| **Console** (React) | http://localhost:8000/console — also where `/` redirects |
| **Dashboard** (Streamlit) | http://localhost:8501 |
| **API docs** | http://localhost:8000/docs |
| **Health check** | http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health |

The console is built inside the backend image (a Node stage compiles `webapp/`, the
runtime stage serves the static bundle at `/console`) and is same-origin with the API,
so it needs no CORS or extra service. The Streamlit dashboard remains available in
parallel.

### 3. Stop

```bash
docker-compose down
```

---

## Local Development (no Docker)

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Terminal 1 — backend
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 — Streamlit dashboard
cd frontend
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8501

# Terminal 3 — React console (optional; hot reload)
cd webapp
npm install
npm run dev                     # http://localhost:5173/console/  (proxies /api → :8000)
```

`.env` is located relative to the source tree, not the working directory, so the
backend finds it from either directory.

The React console can be run two ways: `npm run dev` for hot reload during development
(URL above), or `npm run build` to emit `webapp/dist`, which the backend then serves at
`http://localhost:8000/console`. See [webapp/README.md](webapp/README.md) for the
frontend's architecture and the constraints it enforces (AQI = max of sub-indices; no
fabricated accuracy figures; sample data always labelled).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Required | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| `APP_API_KEY` | Yes | Key for `POST /ingest/*` (X-API-Key header). Ingestion returns `503` while it is unset or still the placeholder |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Yes | Comma-separated frontend origins for CORS |
| `OPENAQ_API_KEY` | Yes | Live station readings. `/realtime/*` returns `502` without it |
| `FIRMS_API_KEY` | For plume | Fire detections. Hotspot list is empty without it — never synthetic |
| `APP_ENV`, `APP_DEBUG` | No | Cosmetic; no behaviour is gated on these yet |

Open-Meteo needs no key, so the forecast and inversion endpoints work with none of
the above set.

```

## Verification

The physics is checked by scripts that print numbers you can argue with, not by
assertions of accuracy:

```bash
python scripts/verify/calib.py       # seasonal box-model behaviour, Aug vs Nov
python scripts/verify/attrib.py      # feedback strength with and without smoke
python scripts/verify/plumecheck.py  # plume emissions, geometry, monotonicity
python scripts/verify/windcheck.py   # wind convention and trajectory direction
```

There is no accuracy claim to reproduce. Producing one requires a backtest against
observations the model never saw; that work is not done, and until it is, the
correct answer to "what is your MAE?" is "we haven't measured it."
